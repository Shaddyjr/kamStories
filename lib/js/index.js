The lion was angry and swiftly grabbed and lifted up the mouse to his face, ready to devour the mouse. The mouse cried out in fear and exclaimed, 'Brother Lion, please don't eat me and let me go. If you release me, one day I will repay you for your kindness.' The lion roared in laughter. 'Haha! What can a small, little mouse like you do to repay me? But since you are so bold to make such a statement, I will set you free this time.' A long time passed. One day, as the lion was crossing the forest, he fell into a hunter's trap and got entangled by the trap's ropes. The lion roared and roared for help. The little mouse that the lion had freed heard the lion's cries and scurried to where the lion was trapped. Using his sharp teeth, the mouse gnawed at the rope bit by bit until the lion was freed from the trap. The lion picked up the mouse, and said with great relief and gratitude, 'Previously when I had set you free, I didn't believe you were really able to repay me. But today, you have saved my life. Thank you, little mouse.'" ,
