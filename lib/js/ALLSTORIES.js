At the age of seven or eight years old, Xianzhi began to learn how to write Chinese calligraphy. One day, Xianzhi asked his dad, 'What is the secret to mastering the art of calligraphy?' The father brings his son out to the front yard and pointed to 18 barrels of water. 'The secret lies there. Grind your ink stone, and use the water from these 18 barrels. When you have finished using the water from all 18 barrels, you will have unraveled the mysteries to the art.'Xianzhi heard this and was shocked upon the revelation. His father was telling him that hard work and perseverance was the secret to become a great calligraphist. Xianzhi then understood that his father's success was also the result of years of patience, hard work and diligence. From then on, Xianzhi used the water from the barrels to write with every day. Several years later, he finished using the water from the 18 barrels, and his skill in Chinese calligraphy improved.When Xianzhi grew up, he became known as 'Little Saint'. The people called him and his father 'The Two Masters'. From the success of Xianzhi and Xianxi, one can see - If one does not put in the time and effort to master a skill, you cannot solely depend upon luck and talent to become successful.",

		"content" : "A long time ago, a mighty lion lived in the forest. One day, as the lion was sleeping in the midst of the forest, a little mouse suddenly ran across his face and woke the lion up. The lion was angry and swiftly grabbed and lifted up the mouse to his face, ready to devour the mouse. The mouse cried out in fear and exclaimed, 'Brother Lion, please don't eat me and let me go. If you release me, one day I will repay you for your kindness.' The lion roared in laughter. 'Haha! What can a small, little mouse like you do to repay me? But since you are so bold to make such a statement, I will set you free this time.' A long time passed. One day, as the lion was crossing the forest, he fell into a hunter's trap and got entangled by the trap's ropes. The lion roared and roared for help. The little mouse that the lion had freed heard the lion's cries and scurried to where the lion was trapped. Using his sharp teeth, the mouse gnawed at the rope bit by bit until the lion was freed from the trap. The lion picked up the mouse, and said with great relief and gratitude, 'Previously when I had set you free, I didn't believe you were really able to repay me. But today, you have saved my life. Thank you, little mouse.'" ,

		"content" : "One day, Confucius's student was outside sweeping when a visitor came to ask him, 'Who are you?' The student proudly exclaimed, 'I am a student of Confucius!' The visitor then said, 'That's great. Can I ask you a question then?' The student happily said, 'Yes!' In his heart, he wondered, what kind of strange question would I be asked? The visitor asked, 'How many seasons are there in a year?' The student thought to himself, what kind of question is that? He then responded, 'Spring, summer, autumn and winter - four seasons.' The visitor shook his head and said, 'Incorrect. A year only has three seasons.' 'Hmf, you are mistaken - four seasons!' 'Three seasons!' In the end, the two could no longer continue the argument, and decided to put down a bet: if there were four seasons, the visitor would bow to the student three times. If there were three seasons, the student would bow to the visitor three times. Confucius's student thought for sure he would win this bet, so he brought the visitor to see his teacher Confucius. At that precise moment, Confucius was coming out of the house. The student approached the teacher and said, 'Teacher, how many seasons are there in a year?' Confucius took one look at the visitor and said, 'A year has three seasons.' The student was shocked beyond words, but he did not dare to immediately question his teacher. The visitor immediately said, 'Quick, bow to me!' The student had no choice but to bow three times to the visitor. After the visitor left,  the student couldn't wait to ask Confucius. 'Teacher, it is obvious that there are four seasons, why did you say there are three seasons?' Confucius said, 'Did you not see that the person's body before was entirely green? He is a locust. Locusts are born in the spring an die in the autumn. He has never seen winter. If you tell him there are three seasons, then he will be satisfied. If you tell him there are four seasons, you can argue until night falls and hear no end to it. You suffer a small loss by bowing three times. It's no big deal.' From this story, the listener can reflect that sometimes it is not necessary to argue if a matter is true or false, right or wrong. To the person who believes in three seasons to be the truth of the matter, it is because they have never seen the evidence of what is in fact truth. Hence, if you get angry and argue with such a person, you are only causing your own suffering.  The next time you want to get angry at someone for not seeing things that way you see them, just remember that this is a 'Three Seasons' person, and your anger may dissipate.",

		"content" : "One day, a butcher came to seek out Confucius on a particular question. Confucius was not present, so Confucius's student said, 'My teacher is currently not at home. Perhaps I can help with your inquiry.' The butcher said to the student, 'People say that there are four seasons in a year, but I believe there are three seasons in a year. How many seasons are there in a year?' The student promptly responded, 'There are four seasons.' The butcher shook his head and did not accept that answer. 'A year only has three seasons.' 'No, there are four seasons!' The argument carried on back and forth until the two decided to put down a bet: if there were four seasons, the butcher would cut off his head to present to the student. If there were three seasons, the student would take off his scholar's cap and present it to the butcher. (The scholar's cap is an item of high prestige to the scholar.' With that bet made, they waited until Confucius returned. When Confucius returned, he listened to the student tell him about the argument and the bet. Without hesitation, Confucius responded, 'A year has three seasons.' The student was shocked beyond words, but he did not dare to immediately question his teacher. The student had no choice but to remove his scholar's cap and bow in apology to the butcher. After the butcher left,  the student couldn't wait to ask Confucius. 'Teacher, it is obvious that there are four seasons, why did you say there are three seasons?' Confucius said, 'If I told the butcher, there are four seasons to a year, he would've cut off his own head in his ignorance. Since I told the butcher there are only three seasons to a year, you only had to remove your scholar's cap. You suffered a small loss of embarrassment in comparison to what the butcher's loss for his life would have been. It's no big deal.' From this story, the listener can reflect that sometimes it is not necessary to argue if a matter is true or false, right or wrong - especially if there are dire consequences attached to one's point of view. To the person who believes in three seasons to be the truth of the matter, it is of their own ignorance and stubbornness that you may not be able to persuade them. Hence, if you get angry and argue with such a person, you are only causing your own suffering.",

		"content" : " One year, during the autumn time,  a flock of swans arrived on a small island by Swan Lake. They flew from the north from faraway lands, getting ready to venture south for the winter. On this island lived a fisherman and his wife. When they saw their in-flown guests, they were extremely happy, bringing them fodder and fish they had caught, feeding them with great compassion and care. Winter came, but this flock of swans still did not continue flying to the south. The surface of the lake froze. The swans had no way of acquiring food. The old couple opened up their grass hut to let the swans stay warm and continue to get their food, until the second spring came when the ice from the lake melted away. Day after day, year after year, every year during the winter time, this old couple provided food and shelter to the swans with great love. Finally, one year, they became quite elderly and had to leave the small island; the swans since then disappeared as well. However, it wasnâ€™t because the swans flew south, but rather on the second year that the lake froze, they died of starvation. In the story, the fisherman couple treated the swans as if they were their beloved children very lovingly and carefully, monitoring food and shelter, day in and day out, year in and year out. With such giving and loving hearts, people could not help but to cry out, 'What a loving couple; what lucky swans!' However, the tragic ending of the swans tell us that it is because of the fisherman coupleâ€™s overexertion of love that caused the swans to become weak and unable to adapt to their environment, causing them to perish under the changed conditions of life. In real day-to-day life, how many parents do the same - spending their whole life wholly providing for their childrenâ€™s food, shelter and comfort in order to give them a loving home! This is the classic story of 'The Fisherman Couple' style of parenting and the parentsâ€™ grand results of selflessness. In actuality, this type of love - this type of meticulous and continuous giving is actually a life trap. Once 'the lake freezes over', their endings will not be any better than the swans. People do need to love, but when love becomes elevated to a state of providing a life of total comfort, a type of over-protection, it is no longer just love, but a gentle looking, deadly blade.

		"length" : "Short",
		"content" : " An old professor asked, 'If you go to the hilltops with the intention to cut down a tree, and you encounter two trees - a thick, strong tree or a smaller tree, which tree would you cut? Once the question was posed, everybody said, 'Of course the thick, strong tree.' The professor laughed and said, 'The thick, strong tree is only a plain poplar tree, and the smaller tree is in fact a red pine tree; now which one would you cut down?' We all thought, the red pine tree is more valuable, so we said, 'Of course, weâ€™ll cut the red pine tree. The poplar tree is not worth any money.' The professorâ€™s smile was unfazed, and as he looked at us and asked, 'That poplar tree is tall and upright while the red pine tree is all crooked and twisted; it would not be of any use.' We were starting to feel a bit skeptical and said, 'If this is the case, weâ€™ll cut the poplar tree. After all the twisted pine tree will not be of any use!' The professorâ€™s eyes glimmered as we guessed he was going to add on more criteria. Indeed, he said, 'Even though the poplar tree is grown straight and upright, because it has aged, the center of the tree is empty. In this case, which tree would you cut?' Even though we did not know what point the professor was getting at, we still responded based on the circumstances he told us, and said, 'Weâ€™ll cut down the red pine. If the center of the poplar tree is empty, it is of no use!' The professor continued without drawing a breath, 'But the poplar tree has a birdâ€™s nest, and a few young birds are hiding in the nest; which tree do you cut?' Finally, someone asked, 'Professor, what is it that you are trying to tell us? What is this trying to test of us?' The professor withdrew his smile and said, 'How come none of you asked yourself, what exactly was the purpose of cutting down a tree? Even if the criteria and circumstances of what you know change, the final decision depends on your motive and reason for action. If your reason is to acquire firewood, then you cut the poplar tree. If your reason is to make a creation piece, you would cut the red pine tree. You do not go to the hills to cut down a tree for no reason!' This story tells us: A person needs to know what their desired goal or outcome is. That way, when you act, you are not sways and confused based on the changing conditions and circumstances that come your way. Do you have a clear goal? If you do, keep up with the good works toward your goal! In life, there are many distractions and temptations that may lead us astray. We need to identify our goals and commit to our dreams. Being steadfast and holding strong to our goals and dream is a virtuous quality. Have you stood your ground?",
