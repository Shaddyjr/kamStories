		"content": "Wang Xianzhi was the youngest of seven siblings, son of Wang Xizhi, a well-renowned calligrapher in China. At the age of seven or eight years old, Xianzhi began to learn how to write Chinese calligraphy. One day, Xianzhi asked his dad, 'What is the secret to mastering the art of calligraphy?'The father brings his son out to the front yard and pointed to 18 barrels of water. 'The secret lies there. Grind your ink stone, and use the water from these 18 barrels. When you have finished using the water from all 18 barrels, you will have unraveled the mysteries to the art.'Xianzhi heard this and was shocked upon the revelation. His father was telling him that hard work and perseverance was the secret to become a great calligraphist. Xianzhi then understood that his father's success was also the result of years of patience, hard work and diligence. From then on, Xianzhi used the water from the barrels to write with every day. Several years later, he finished using the water from the 18 barrels, and his skill in Chinese calligraphy improved.When Xianzhi grew up, he became known as 'Little Saint'. The people called him and his father 'The Two Masters'. From the success of Xianzhi and Xianxi, one can see - If one does not put in the time and effort to master a skill, you cannot solely depend upon luck and talent to become successful.",
